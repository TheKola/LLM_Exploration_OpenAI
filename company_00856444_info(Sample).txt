But as we and the UK transition towards net zero that will change. This decade we plan to increase to 50% our capital expenditure on our transition businesses globally, and reduce oil and gas production by around 40%. The UK has a plan to boost long-term energy security and cut emissions. At bp, we’re already hard at work on the challenge. Our UK investment plans include billions for solutions like offshore wind, EV charging, hydrogen and carbon capture, as well as maintaining a secure supply of energy through North Sea oil and gas. And our plans go beyond just infrastructure - they see us supporting the economy, skills development and job opportunities in the communities where we operate.

Three areas of focus Resilient hydrocarbons – high-grading our portfolio, lowering our emissions and driving returns. Convenience and mobility – doubling adjusted EBITDA, sustaining returns, focused on customers. Low carbon energy – building scale with capital discipline and returns focus. What makes us different We believe we have the scale and expertise to navigate complex markets and manage increasingly integrated energy systems. Integrating energy systems – harnessing our collective capabilities as the energy system transitions, helping more customers get the energy they want and creating value for our shareholders. Partnering with countries, cities and industries – by leveraging relationships and building new partnerships we aim to provide integrated energy and mobility solutions to help cities and industries reduce carbon emissions while creating exciting business opportunities. Driving digital innovation – we innovate with a strong focus on digital to drive operational efficiencies, empower our workforce and engage better with our customers. This includes building new businesses through bp ventures and Launchpad. “By following this strategy, we expect bp to be a very different energy company by 2030.” Bernard Looney, chief executive officer Our sustainability frame Our sustainability frame links our strategy to our purpose – to reimagine energy for people and our planet. Three focus areas: net zero, people and planet – include prioritised themes linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals . Aims and objectives: we have set aims and objectives for our focus areas on people and planet, as we did with net zero. Embedding into our DNA : we plan to actively drive the sustainability frame through our operating model, our governance and our culture. External collaborations: we plan to continue the search for partnerships that can help us drive progress, provide skills we may not have, and help us shape the future together.

These provide the basis for a common set of enduring objectives for bp as we transform the organization consistent with the long-term energy transition . Here are some examples of how we performed in 2021. Strengthening our US presence In 2021 we started up two major projects in the US Gulf of Mexico, where we plan to grow our oil and gas production to around 400mboe/d net by the mid-2020s Growth in Europe We are accelerating our electric vehicle (EV) charging ambition across key growth markets, through a focus on ‘on-the-go’ charging and fleets. Partnerships are a key part of our approach, enabling better and faster utilization of our network. In 2021, we took significant steps towards our aim to grow our EV charge points to more than 100,000 globally by 2030 Developing our presence in Asia-Pacific In 2021 we started directly supplying customers in China with gas from liquefied natural gas (LNG) imported by bp, completing our first fully integrated gas value chain into the country. bp Energy Outlook 2022 edition Energy Outlook Energy Outlook 2022 explores the key uncertainties surrounding the energy transition and is focussed on three main scenarios: Accelerated, Net Zero and New Momentum Find out more Key downloads Our key reports include information about our financial and operating performance, sustainability performance and also global energy trends and projections.

Hydrogen explained Blue hydrogen is extracted from natural gas with the carbon dioxide captured and stored. Green hydrogen results from the electrolysis of water using renewable power. Our aim We aim to develop a leading market position producing and supplying low carbon hydrogen, capturing 10% of core markets by 2030. bp’s world-scale hydrogen project, part of Net Zero Teesside, aims to produce 1GW of blue hydrogen starting in 2027, capturing and sending for storage up to 2 million tons of CO2 per year. That’s equivalent to the energy use of 218,492 UK households. Our progress In the UK, we aim to produce up to 1.5GW of blue and green hydrogen by 2030. And we are planning seven world-class low carbon hydrogen hubs across Europe, the Middle East and Australia. Previous Next Close Slide 1 of 2 Our aim Convenience is an important part of our strategy to transform. As customers increasingly come to our forecourts to shop as well as charge, the retail experience will be key. We aim to expand our strategic convenience network (sites that have fuel as well as food for now and food for later offers) to around 3,500 sites globally by 2030. And, we’re planning to increase our customer touchpoints from around 12 million a day in 2021 to more than 15 million by 2025 and 20 million by 2030. Our progress We’re integrating our fast EV charging experience with our leading convenience offers and services. We’re: Expanding our strategic convenience network, with 2,200 globally today. Expanding in growth markets, such as our Jio-bp network of retail stations in India. Extending our partnership with Marks & Spencer in the UK. Taking full ownership of Thorntons in the US. We’re offering attractive digital solutions and loyalty programmes. We have around 16 million active loyalty customers. Previous Next Close Slide 1 of 2 Our aim bp is aiming to install more than 100,000 charging points globally by 2030. We expect around 90% of those to be rapid or ultra-fast, resulting in around 10 gigawatts of installed capacity. This is equivalent to around 30 billion EV miles driven per year. As part of a new £1 billion investment plan in the UK over 10 years, bp pulse is set to approximately triple its number of charging points by 2030. Our progress We have around 16,000 charging points globally. Around 50% are now rapid or ultra-fast – that’s at least 50kW for rapid, more than 150kW for ultra-fast. 150kW chargers are capable of delivering up to 160km of range in as little as 10 minutes of charging, depending on the model of vehicle. We are the leading provider of ultra-fast charging in Germany, building on our leading position in the UK. And we have announced partnerships with VW and Iberdrola to accelerate our rollout plans across Europe. Previous Next Close Slide 1 of 3 Our aim We aim to have developed 20GW of renewable generating capacity by 2025 and 50GW by 2030. That’s broadly enough to meet the power needs of 36 million people. GW explained A gigawatt is how we measure the scale of our renewable energy projects. 1 gigawatt (GW) = 1,000 megawatts = 1 billion watts. For example, a 1GW solar farm in the US could power 12 billion hours of TV viewing a year. Our progress We’re on track. Our developed and renewables pipeline was 30.1GW at 2Q 2022, up 0.9GW from 1Q, driven by an increase in Lightsource bp solar pipeline. Breaking down the numbers Developed renewables to final investment decision: 4.4GW. Renewables pipeline at the end of the quarter: 25.8GW (bp net) – up from 6GW in 2019. Renewables share Over time, as investment goes up in low and zero carbon, we see it going down in oil and gas. Our 2021 investment increased due to our continuing acceleration in offshore wind and solar, as well as advancing mobility with a bolder ambition in electrification. Our low carbon investment focus will be on renewables, bioenergy, EV charging, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. Previous Next Close Slide 1 of 3 Resilient hydrocarbons We started up 11 major projects in two years. These are part of a programme of 35 projects initiated in 2016, completed on schedule and, on average, around 15% under budget. As part of our strategy, we plan to high-grade our portfolio, lower our emissions and drive higher returns. And, as the world seeks lower carbon fuels, we see potential to use our refining facilities to help create bioenergy. Our aim We aim to sustain oil and gas earnings at $30-35 billion a year until 2030, even as we reduce output by 40%. We plan to do this by: Removing costs. Focusing on high-margin projects. Focusing on six regions. Our progress Our methane intensity in 2021 was 0.07%, an improvement from 0.12% in 2020. Methane emissions from upstream operations, used to calculate intensity, decreased to around 43.0 kilotons (kt), from 71.6kt in 2020. This continues a declining trend in absolute upstream methane emissions since 2016. Previous Next Close Slide 1 of 3 Winds of change We started 2019 with 0GW of offshore wind generating capacity. After successful bids in some of the fastest-growing regions, our offshore wind pipeline is now 5.2GW. GW explained A gigawatt is how we measure the scale of our renewable energy projects. 1 gigawatt (GW) = 1,000 megawatts = 1 billion watts. For example, 1GW of offshore wind power each year in the US provides enough electricity to make 150 billion cups of coffee. Our aim bp aims to build a world-class wind energy business. Offshore wind is growing at around 20% a year globally and recognized as being a core part of the world’s need to limit emissions. That’s why it has a central role to play as we deliver on our strategy. Our progress We are already investing in building offshore wind developments that match our scale and ambition. bp and Equinor are developing four offshore wind assets with a capacity of 2.2GW in the US. And with our partner EnBW, we are developing three offshore wind projects in two major UK locations with a capacity of about 3GW. All together, these projects have the potential to power more than five million homes. Recently, we’ve agreed to form a partnership with Marubeni to explore an offshore wind development in Japan. Previous Next Close Slide 1 of 3 Future fuel Biofuels are one of the best large-scale solutions to decarbonizing transportation. Under our Energy Outlook Accelerated scenario, biofuels use increases more than two-fold to 6-7Mb/d by 2050. Bio-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) accounts for 30% of aviation fuel demand by 2050. Bioenergy explained Bioenergy – or biofuels – is renewable energy from recently living organic materials known as biomass that can be used to produce transportation fuels, heat, electricity, and products. Our aim We aim to triple our bioenergy production to more than 100,000 barrels per day (b/d) by 2030. We will increase biofuels production three-fold at three of our refineries through bio co-processing, and invest in five major biofuels projects by 2030. This includes three standalone bio-plants and the conversion of up to two bio-refineries. Our progress We’re transforming our refineries at Castellón in Spain and Lingen in Germany to co-process biofuels, including SAF. And in biogas, through our co-marketing agreement with Clean Energy Fuels, we are already the largest supplier to US heavy-duty fleet customers. We acquired a 29% stake in Gasrec, a major UK provider of biogas to heavy goods vehicles, to help decarbonize businesses across the construction, freight, off-road, and marine industries. Previous Next Close Slide 1 of 4 Net zero operations We aim to be net zero across our operations on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner. Net zero explained A state of net zero GHG emissions. This can be achieved by balancing relevant emissions with total applicable deductions (through qualifying activities). Net zero operations explained Aim 1 relates to our Scope 1 (from running the assets within our operational control boundary) and Scope 2 (associated with producing electricity, heating and cooling that is brought to run these operations) GHG emissions. Our aim Having exceeded our 2025 target, we have more to do to reduce emissions. We’re now working towards our 2030 aim of reducing operational emissions by 50% compared to 2019. Our progress In 2019, our combined Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions totalled 54.4MtCO2e. We’ve reduced this to 35.6MtCO2e. MtCO2e explained Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. The actions we’re taking, include: Energy efficiency measures. Electrification of centralized facilities. Reducing flaring and managing methane. CCS. Our progress explained A 35% reduction of bp’s carbon emissions is the equivalent of more than 2 million homes’ energy use for one year. Previous Next Close Slide 1 of 3 Net zero production We’ve set aims to achieve our overall net zero ambition by reducing emissions while bringing new projects online. Net zero production explained Our aim (Aim 2) is to be net zero on an absolute basis across the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production by 2050 or sooner. This is our Scope 3 aim, and is based on bp’s net share of production*. This will mean cutting emissions from our upstream oil and gas production from our 2019 baseline of around 361MtCo2. * Excluding bp’s share of production in Rosneft. Our aim Our aim is to be net zero on an absolute basis across the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production by 2050 or sooner. Portfolio optimization Reducing production will be key to our Aim 2, to be net zero on an absolute basis across the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production. We expect a fall in production by around 40% by 2030 – from 2.6 million barrrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d) in 2019 to 1.5Mboe/d in 2030.

Delaying decisive action to reduce emissions sustainably could lead to significant economic and social costs. Find out more Government ambitions globally have grown markedly in the past few years pointing to new, increased momentum in tackling climate change. But there is significant uncertainty as to how successful countries and regions will be in achieving those aims and pledges. Find out more The structure of energy demand changes , with the importance of fossil fuels gradually declining, replaced by a growing share of renewable energy and increasing electrification. The transition to a low-carbon world requires a range of other energy sources and technologies, including low-carbon hydrogen, modern bioenergy, and carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS). Find out more The movement to a lower carbon energy system leads to a fundamental restructuring of global energy markets , with a more diversified energy mix, increased levels of competition, shifting economic rents, and a greater role for customer choice. Find out more Oil demand increases to above its pre-COVID-19 level before falling further out. Declines in oil demand are driven by the increasing efficiency and electrification of road transportation. Natural declines in existing hydrocarbon production imply continuing investment in new upstream oil and gas is required over the next 30 years . Find out more The use of natural gas is supported, at least for a period, by increasing demand in fast-growing emerging economies as they continue to industrialize and reduce their reliance on coal. Growth in liquefied natural gas plays a central role in increasing emerging markets’ access to natural gas. Find out more Wind and solar power expand rapidly , accounting for all or most of the increase in global power generation, underpinned by continuing falls in their costs and an increasing ability of power systems to integrate high concentrations of variable power sources. The growth in wind and solar power requires a substantial increase in the pace of investment in both new capacity and enabling technologies and infrastructure. Find out more The use of modern bioenergy increases substantially , providing a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels in hard-to-abate sectors. Find out more The use of low-carbon hydrogen increases as the energy system progressively decarbonizes , carrying energy to activities and processes which are difficult to electrify, especially in industry and transport. The production of low-carbon hydrogen is dominated by green and blue hydrogen, with green hydrogen growing in importance over time. Find out more CCUS plays a central role in supporting a low-carbon energy system: capturing emissions from industrial processes, providing a source of carbon dioxide removals, and abating emissions from fossil fuels. Find out more A range of carbon dioxide removals – including bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage, natural climate solutions, and direct air capture with storage – may be needed for the world to achieve a deep and rapid decarbonization.

Between 2019 and 2021, renewable energy increased by over 8EJ. Consumption of fossil fuels was broadly unchanged. Fossil fuels accounted for 82% of primary energy use last year, down from 83% in 2019 and 85% five years ago. INTERACTIVE CHART Primary energy in 2021 grew by its largest amount in history, with emerging economies accounting for most of the increase Find out more INTERACTIVE CHART The increase in carbon emissions in 2021 was driven by the rebound in economic growth Find out more Carbon emissions Carbon dioxide emissions from energy use, industrial processes, flaring and methane (in carbon dioxide equivalent) rose 5.7% in 2021 to 39.0 GtCO 2 e, with carbon dioxide emissions from energy rising 5.9% to 33.9 GtCO 2 , close to 2019 levels. Carbon dioxide emissions from flaring and emissions from methane and industrial processes rose more modestly by 2.9% and 4.6% respectively. Oil Oil prices averaged $70.91/bbl in 2021, the second highest level since 2015 Oil consumption increased by 5.3 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2021 but remained 3.7 million b/d below 2019 levels. A majority of the consumption growth came from gasoline (1.8 million b/d) and diesel/gasoil (1.3 million b/d). Regionally, most of the growth took place in the US (1.5 million b/d), China (1.3 million b/d) and the EU (570,000 b/d). Global oil production increased by 1.4 million b/d in 2021, with OPEC+ accounting for more than three-quarters of the increase. Among all countries, Libya (840,000 b/d), Iran (540,000 b/d) and Canada (300,000 b/d) saw the largest increases. Nigeria (-200,000 b/d), the UK (-170,000 b/d) and Angola (-150,000 b/d) reported the biggest declines. Refinery capacity declined for the first time in over 30 years by almost 500,000 b/d last year, driven by a sharp reduction in the OECD (1.1 million b/d). As a result, refining capacity in the OECD in 2021 was at its lowest level since 1998. INTERACTIVE CHART Oil demand in 2021 remained below 2019 levels Find out more Trade: Russia accounted for 20-40% of the EU’s oil, gas, and coal consumption in 2021 Find out more Natural gas Natural gas prices rebounded strongly across all three major gas regions in 2021, rising fourfold to record annual levels in Europe (TTF averaging $16.02/mmBtu) and tripling in the Asian LNG spot market (JKM averaging $18.60/mmBtu). US Henry Hub prices nearly doubled to average $3.84/mmBtu in 2021 - their highest annual level since 2014. Global natural gas demand grew 5.3% in 2021, recovering above pre-pandemic 2019 levels and crossing the 4 Tcm mark for the first time. Its share in primary energy in 2021 was unchanged from the previous year at 24%. LNG supply grew 5.6% (+26 Bcm) to 516 Bcm in 2021, its slowest rate of growth since 2015 (other than in 2020). LNG supply from the US rose by 34 Bcm, accounting for most of the new incremental supplies and more than offsetting declines from mainly other Atlantic Basin exporters. China surpassed Japan as the world’s largest LNG importer and accounted for close to 60% of global LNG demand growth in 2021. Algerian pipeline exports to Europe were the largest source of pipeline supply growth to the region (+13 Bcm) last year, followed by Azerbaijan (+6 Bcm). While Russian pipeline supply to Europe overall was steady at 167 Bcm in 2021, exports to the EU decreased by 8.2% (-12 Bcm). Coal Coal prices rose dramatically in 2021, with European prices averaging $121/tonne and the Asian marker price averaging $145/t, its highest since 2008. Coal consumption grew over 6% in 2021 to 160 EJ, slightly above 2019 levels and its highest level since 2014. China and India accounted for over 70% of the growth in coal demand in 2021, increasing by 3.7 and 2.7 EJ, respectively. Global production matched consumption with an increase in supply of 440mt. China and India accounted for much of the increase in production, which was largely consumed domestically, as well as Indonesia, supporting higher exports. Notably, both Europe and North America showed an increase in coal consumption in 2021 after nearly 10 years of back-to-back declines. Electricity Electricity generation increased by 6.2% in 2021 – similar to the strong bounce back seen in 2010 in the aftermath of the financial crisis (6.4%). Wind and solar reached a 10.2% share of power generation in 2021, the first time wind and solar power have provided more than 10% of global power and surpassing the contribution of nuclear energy. Coal remained the dominant fuel for power generation in 2021, with its share increasing to 36%, up from 35.1% in 2020. Natural gas in power generation increased by 2.6% in 2021, although its share decreased from 23.7% in 2020 to 22.9% in 2021. Renewables, hydro and nuclear energy Renewable primary energy (including biofuels but excluding hydro) increased by around 5.1 EJ in 2021 – corresponding to an annual growth rate of 15%, stronger than the previous year’s 9%, and higher than that of any other fuel in 2021. Solar and wind capacity continued to grow rapidly in 2021, increasing by 226 GW, close to the record increase of 236 GW seen in 2020. China remained the main driver of solar and wind capacity growth last year, accounting for about 36% and 40% of the global capacity additions, respectively. Hydroelectricity generation decreased by around 1.4% in 2021, the first fall since 2015. In contrast, nuclear generation increased by 4.2% – the strongest increase since 2004 – led by China. INTERACTIVE CHART The share of renewables in global power generation continued to increase Find out more INTERACTIVE CHART Commodities : energy and mineral prices increased in 2021 and continued to do so in 2022 Find out more Key minerals The price of cobalt increased 63% in 2021 to average $51,000/tonne. Similarly, lithium carbonate prices rose 58% to average $11,000/tonne. So far in 2022, mineral prices have continued to surge. Lithium production rose sharply by 27%, Cobalt output was up by only 4%.

Our people have continued to work hard throughout the quarter helping to solve the energy trilemma – secure, affordable and lower carbon energy. We do this by providing the oil and gas the world needs today – while at the same time, investing to accelerate the energy transition.” Bernard Looney, chief executive officer Highlights Underlying replacement cost profit* $8.5 billion Underlying replacement cost profit was $8.5 billion, compared with $6.2 billion for the previous quarter. This was driven by strong realized refining margins, continuing exceptional oil trading performance and higher liquids realizations. This was partly offset by an average gas marketing and trading contribution, down from the exceptional result in the first quarter, including an impact from the ongoing outage at Freeport LNG. Reported profit for the quarter was $9.3 billion, compared with a loss of $20.4 billion for the first quarter 2022. The reported result for the second quarter includes a charge for adjusting items* before tax of $0.3 billion within which are adverse fair value accounting effects* of $0.8 billion. The first quarter loss included a post-tax charge of $24.4 billion relating to bp's decision to exit its 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft in Russia. Operating cash flow* $10.9 billion; net debt* reduced to $22.8 billion Operating cash flow in the quarter of $10.9 billion includes $1.2 billion of Gulf of Mexico oil spill payments within a working capital* build of $2.9 billion (after adjusting for inventory holding gains* and fair value accounting effects). During the second quarter bp executed share buybacks of $2.3 billion. The $2.5-billion programme announced with the first-quarter 2022 results was completed on 22 July. Net debt fell for the ninth successive quarter to reach $22.8 billion at the end of the second quarter. Growing distributions within an unchanged financial frame A resilient dividend is bp’s first priority within its disciplined financial frame. It is underpinned by an average 2021-5 cash balance point* of around $40 per barrel Brent, $11 per barrel RMM and $3 per mmBtu Henry Hub (all 2020 real). bp has announced a 10% increase in its quarterly dividend to 6.006 cents per ordinary share. This increase reflects the underlying performance and cash generation of the business, which has enabled strong progress in delivering share buybacks and net debt reduction. Looking ahead, on average, based on bp's current forecasts, bp continues to expect to have capacity for an annual increase in the dividend per ordinary share of around 4% through 2025 at around $60 per barrel Brent and subject to the board’s discretion each quarter. During the second quarter bp generated surplus cash flow* of $6.6 billion and intends to execute a $3.5 billion share buyback prior to announcing its third-quarter results. bp has now announced share buybacks from 2021 and first-half 2022 surplus cash flow equivalent to 60% of the cumulative surplus cash flow. For 2022 and subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, bp remains committed to using 60% of surplus cash flow for share buybacks and intends to allocate the remaining 40% to further strengthen the balance sheet. Progressing transformation to an Integrated Energy Company In resilient hydrocarbons bp has strengthened its renewal options partnering with Petrobras in a successful Drill Stem Test at the Cabo Frio discovery in the Campos Basin offshore Brazil and participating in the Timpan-1 discovery offshore Indonesia. bp continues to high-grade its portfolio, agreeing to acquire a 35% interest in the undeveloped Bay du Nord discovery offshore Canada as part of the transaction to sell its 50% interest in the Sunrise oil sands project. In convenience and mobility bp has continued to progress its EV charging strategy, recently announcing expansion plans with Iberdrola in Spain and Portugal and signing a contract to operate China's largest fast (a) EV charging hub. In low carbon energy bp has announced plans to take a 40.5% stake in the AREH project to lead and operate one of the world’s largest planned renewables and green hydrogen* energy hubs based in Western Australia; has announced its intent to partner with Iberdrola to develop large-scale integrated green hydrogen production in Spain, Portugal and the UK; and has continued to progress its renewables strategy, submitting bids for two offshore wind leases in the Netherlands. * For items marked with an asterisk throughout this document, definitions are provided in the Glossary on page 36 (a) “fast charging” includes rapid charging ≥50kW and ultra-fast charging ≥150kW Read the stock exchange announcement Dividends Results presentation bp's chief executive officer, Bernard Looney and chief financial officer, Murray Auchincloss hosted a webcast covering our results for the second quarter 2022.

That could be initiatives that provide lower carbon alternatives, like renewable energy or cookstoves to replace open fires. Or it could be projects that protect or enhance natural resources that absorb carbon from the atmosphere – such as land and forests. These projects are awarded a carbon credit for each tonne of carbon reduced or avoided. The carbon credits are certified and issued by an independent body such as the UN CDM, Gold Standard or Verra. By creating a market where people can buy and sell carbon ‘credits’ – a greenhouse gas emission on one part of the planet can be offset by a reduction somewhere else. bp Target Neutral believes in ‘offsetting done well’ so we work to a rigorous assessment criteria and selection process that seek to ensure the integrity of the emissions reductions and the positive impact on the communities the projects operate in. The bp Target Neutral service has helped customer reduce and offset millions of tonnes of carbon. In addition, the offset projects we have supported have also contributed to improving the lives of people in communities around the world through better access to energy, health, education, and jobs, and protecting thousands of hectares of globally significant habitat. We source carbon credits from a portfolio of high-quality offset projects . How does carbon offsetting work Adam Hart-Davis explains offsetting Our carbon offset project portfolio By taking action to offset your carbon footprint, you are providing funds that bp Target Neutral invests on your behalf in a range of different projects around the world that reduce emissions These projects help improve livelihoods in the communities where they're based. bp Copyright © 1996-2022 Legal notice Privacy statement Terms and conditions Cookie preferences Site map Contact bp Target Neutral ", " Contact BP Target Neutral | bp Target Neutral  Site Traffic Information and Cookies We use cookies (and equivalent technologies) to collect and analyse information on our site's performance and to enable the site to function.

Going through the carbon neutral process can help dealerships identify carbon and cost savings in your business, enhance your brand and customer offer, motivate your staff and create competitive advantage. Carbon neutral means that there is no net increase in the global emissions of greenhouse gases as a result of your business operations. It requires that a carbon reduction in absolute terms or in emissions intensity is achieved, and carbon offsets are then used to compensate for the remainder of the emissions. Carbon neutrality requires an ongoing commitment to reduce carbon emissions in absolute terms over time as part of a long-term carbon reduction plan. This is achieved by applying a 5-step approach to carbon neutrality set out in the bp Target Neutral Carbon Neutral Protocol . Using the Castrol Path 360 programme, auto dealers can become carbon neutral businesses by reducing their emissions and then offsetting residual emissions through the bp Target Neutral service. This can help to build reputation amongst climate conscious customers. Dealers can also offer customers the chance to offset their own carbon emissions – for a set mileage – within the sale or service of vehicles. For more information on the Castrol PATH 360 Dealer Programme, click here. Carbon neutral protocol We only use carbon credits that are or will be validated, verified and registered under international offset standards.

Three areas of focus Resilient hydrocarbons – high-grading our portfolio, lowering our emissions and driving returns. Convenience and mobility – doubling adjusted EBITDA, sustaining returns, focused on customers. Low carbon energy – building scale with capital discipline and returns focus. What makes us different We believe we have the scale and expertise to navigate complex markets and manage increasingly integrated energy systems. Integrating energy systems – harnessing our collective capabilities as the energy system transitions, helping more customers get the energy they want and creating value for our shareholders. Partnering with countries, cities and industries – by leveraging relationships and building new partnerships we aim to provide integrated energy and mobility solutions to help cities and industries reduce carbon emissions while creating exciting business opportunities. Driving digital innovation – we innovate with a strong focus on digital to drive operational efficiencies, empower our workforce and engage better with our customers. This includes building new businesses through bp ventures and Launchpad. “By following this strategy, we expect bp to be a very different energy company by 2030.” Bernard Looney, chief executive officer Our sustainability frame Our sustainability frame links our strategy to our purpose – to reimagine energy for people and our planet. Three focus areas: net zero, people and planet – include prioritised themes linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals . Aims and objectives: we have set aims and objectives for our focus areas on people and planet, as we did with net zero.

Hydrogen explained Blue hydrogen is extracted from natural gas with the carbon dioxide captured and stored. Green hydrogen results from the electrolysis of water using renewable power. Our aim We aim to develop a leading market position producing and supplying low carbon hydrogen, capturing 10% of core markets by 2030. bp’s world-scale hydrogen project, part of Net Zero Teesside, aims to produce 1GW of blue hydrogen starting in 2027, capturing and sending for storage up to 2 million tons of CO2 per year. That’s equivalent to the energy use of 218,492 UK households. Our progress In the UK, we aim to produce up to 1.5GW of blue and green hydrogen by 2030. And we are planning seven world-class low carbon hydrogen hubs across Europe, the Middle East and Australia. Previous Next Close Slide 1 of 2 Our aim Convenience is an important part of our strategy to transform. As customers increasingly come to our forecourts to shop as well as charge, the retail experience will be key. We aim to expand our strategic convenience network (sites that have fuel as well as food for now and food for later offers) to around 3,500 sites globally by 2030. And, we’re planning to increase our customer touchpoints from around 12 million a day in 2021 to more than 15 million by 2025 and 20 million by 2030. Our progress We’re integrating our fast EV charging experience with our leading convenience offers and services. We’re: Expanding our strategic convenience network, with 2,200 globally today. Expanding in growth markets, such as our Jio-bp network of retail stations in India. Extending our partnership with Marks & Spencer in the UK. Taking full ownership of Thorntons in the US. We’re offering attractive digital solutions and loyalty programmes. We have around 16 million active loyalty customers. Previous Next Close Slide 1 of 2 Our aim bp is aiming to install more than 100,000 charging points globally by 2030. We expect around 90% of those to be rapid or ultra-fast, resulting in around 10 gigawatts of installed capacity. This is equivalent to around 30 billion EV miles driven per year. As part of a new £1 billion investment plan in the UK over 10 years, bp pulse is set to approximately triple its number of charging points by 2030. Our progress We have around 16,000 charging points globally. Around 50% are now rapid or ultra-fast – that’s at least 50kW for rapid, more than 150kW for ultra-fast. 150kW chargers are capable of delivering up to 160km of range in as little as 10 minutes of charging, depending on the model of vehicle. We are the leading provider of ultra-fast charging in Germany, building on our leading position in the UK. And we have announced partnerships with VW and Iberdrola to accelerate our rollout plans across Europe. Previous Next Close Slide 1 of 3 Our aim We aim to have developed 20GW of renewable generating capacity by 2025 and 50GW by 2030. That’s broadly enough to meet the power needs of 36 million people. GW explained A gigawatt is how we measure the scale of our renewable energy projects. 1 gigawatt (GW) = 1,000 megawatts = 1 billion watts. For example, a 1GW solar farm in the US could power 12 billion hours of TV viewing a year. Our progress We’re on track. Our developed and renewables pipeline was 30.1GW at 2Q 2022, up 0.9GW from 1Q, driven by an increase in Lightsource bp solar pipeline. Breaking down the numbers Developed renewables to final investment decision: 4.4GW. Renewables pipeline at the end of the quarter: 25.8GW (bp net) – up from 6GW in 2019. Renewables share Over time, as investment goes up in low and zero carbon, we see it going down in oil and gas. Our 2021 investment increased due to our continuing acceleration in offshore wind and solar, as well as advancing mobility with a bolder ambition in electrification. Our low carbon investment focus will be on renewables, bioenergy, EV charging, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. Previous Next Close Slide 1 of 3 Resilient hydrocarbons We started up 11 major projects in two years. These are part of a programme of 35 projects initiated in 2016, completed on schedule and, on average, around 15% under budget. As part of our strategy, we plan to high-grade our portfolio, lower our emissions and drive higher returns. And, as the world seeks lower carbon fuels, we see potential to use our refining facilities to help create bioenergy. Our aim We aim to sustain oil and gas earnings at $30-35 billion a year until 2030, even as we reduce output by 40%. We plan to do this by: Removing costs. Focusing on high-margin projects. Focusing on six regions. Our progress Our methane intensity in 2021 was 0.07%, an improvement from 0.12% in 2020. Methane emissions from upstream operations, used to calculate intensity, decreased to around 43.0 kilotons (kt), from 71.6kt in 2020. This continues a declining trend in absolute upstream methane emissions since 2016. Previous Next Close Slide 1 of 3 Winds of change We started 2019 with 0GW of offshore wind generating capacity. After successful bids in some of the fastest-growing regions, our offshore wind pipeline is now 5.2GW. GW explained A gigawatt is how we measure the scale of our renewable energy projects. 1 gigawatt (GW) = 1,000 megawatts = 1 billion watts. For example, 1GW of offshore wind power each year in the US provides enough electricity to make 150 billion cups of coffee. Our aim bp aims to build a world-class wind energy business. Offshore wind is growing at around 20% a year globally and recognized as being a core part of the world’s need to limit emissions. That’s why it has a central role to play as we deliver on our strategy. Our progress We are already investing in building offshore wind developments that match our scale and ambition. bp and Equinor are developing four offshore wind assets with a capacity of 2.2GW in the US. And with our partner EnBW, we are developing three offshore wind projects in two major UK locations with a capacity of about 3GW. All together, these projects have the potential to power more than five million homes. Recently, we’ve agreed to form a partnership with Marubeni to explore an offshore wind development in Japan. Previous Next Close Slide 1 of 3 Future fuel Biofuels are one of the best large-scale solutions to decarbonizing transportation. Under our Energy Outlook Accelerated scenario, biofuels use increases more than two-fold to 6-7Mb/d by 2050. Bio-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) accounts for 30% of aviation fuel demand by 2050. Bioenergy explained Bioenergy – or biofuels – is renewable energy from recently living organic materials known as biomass that can be used to produce transportation fuels, heat, electricity, and products. Our aim We aim to triple our bioenergy production to more than 100,000 barrels per day (b/d) by 2030. We will increase biofuels production three-fold at three of our refineries through bio co-processing, and invest in five major biofuels projects by 2030. This includes three standalone bio-plants and the conversion of up to two bio-refineries. Our progress We’re transforming our refineries at Castellón in Spain and Lingen in Germany to co-process biofuels, including SAF. And in biogas, through our co-marketing agreement with Clean Energy Fuels, we are already the largest supplier to US heavy-duty fleet customers. We acquired a 29% stake in Gasrec, a major UK provider of biogas to heavy goods vehicles, to help decarbonize businesses across the construction, freight, off-road, and marine industries. Previous Next Close Slide 1 of 4 Net zero operations We aim to be net zero across our operations on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner. Net zero explained A state of net zero GHG emissions. This can be achieved by balancing relevant emissions with total applicable deductions (through qualifying activities). Net zero operations explained Aim 1 relates to our Scope 1 (from running the assets within our operational control boundary) and Scope 2 (associated with producing electricity, heating and cooling that is brought to run these operations) GHG emissions. Our aim Having exceeded our 2025 target, we have more to do to reduce emissions. We’re now working towards our 2030 aim of reducing operational emissions by 50% compared to 2019. Our progress In 2019, our combined Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions totalled 54.4MtCO2e. We’ve reduced this to 35.6MtCO2e. MtCO2e explained Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. The actions we’re taking, include: Energy efficiency measures. Electrification of centralized facilities. Reducing flaring and managing methane. CCS. Our progress explained A 35% reduction of bp’s carbon emissions is the equivalent of more than 2 million homes’ energy use for one year. Previous Next Close Slide 1 of 3 Net zero production We’ve set aims to achieve our overall net zero ambition by reducing emissions while bringing new projects online. Net zero production explained Our aim (Aim 2) is to be net zero on an absolute basis across the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production by 2050 or sooner. This is our Scope 3 aim, and is based on bp’s net share of production*. This will mean cutting emissions from our upstream oil and gas production from our 2019 baseline of around 361MtCo2. * Excluding bp’s share of production in Rosneft. Our aim Our aim is to be net zero on an absolute basis across the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production by 2050 or sooner. Portfolio optimization Reducing production will be key to our Aim 2, to be net zero on an absolute basis across the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production. We expect a fall in production by around 40% by 2030 – from 2.6 million barrrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboe/d) in 2019 to 1.5Mboe/d in 2030. Our progress Emissions from the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production fell by around 57MtCO2e, a 16% reduction, including through divestments and existing field decline. MtCO2e explained Metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Previous Next BP p.l.c.

Delaying decisive action to reduce emissions sustainably could lead to significant economic and social costs. Find out more Government ambitions globally have grown markedly in the past few years pointing to new, increased momentum in tackling climate change. But there is significant uncertainty as to how successful countries and regions will be in achieving those aims and pledges. Find out more The structure of energy demand changes , with the importance of fossil fuels gradually declining, replaced by a growing share of renewable energy and increasing electrification. The transition to a low-carbon world requires a range of other energy sources and technologies, including low-carbon hydrogen, modern bioenergy, and carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS). Find out more The movement to a lower carbon energy system leads to a fundamental restructuring of global energy markets , with a more diversified energy mix, increased levels of competition, shifting economic rents, and a greater role for customer choice. Find out more Oil demand increases to above its pre-COVID-19 level before falling further out. Declines in oil demand are driven by the increasing efficiency and electrification of road transportation. Natural declines in existing hydrocarbon production imply continuing investment in new upstream oil and gas is required over the next 30 years . Find out more The use of natural gas is supported, at least for a period, by increasing demand in fast-growing emerging economies as they continue to industrialize and reduce their reliance on coal. Growth in liquefied natural gas plays a central role in increasing emerging markets’ access to natural gas. Find out more Wind and solar power expand rapidly , accounting for all or most of the increase in global power generation, underpinned by continuing falls in their costs and an increasing ability of power systems to integrate high concentrations of variable power sources. The growth in wind and solar power requires a substantial increase in the pace of investment in both new capacity and enabling technologies and infrastructure. Find out more The use of modern bioenergy increases substantially , providing a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels in hard-to-abate sectors. Find out more The use of low-carbon hydrogen increases as the energy system progressively decarbonizes , carrying energy to activities and processes which are difficult to electrify, especially in industry and transport. The production of low-carbon hydrogen is dominated by green and blue hydrogen, with green hydrogen growing in importance over time. Find out more CCUS plays a central role in supporting a low-carbon energy system: capturing emissions from industrial processes, providing a source of carbon dioxide removals, and abating emissions from fossil fuels. Find out more A range of carbon dioxide removals – including bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage, natural climate solutions, and direct air capture with storage – may be needed for the world to achieve a deep and rapid decarbonization.

Between 2019 and 2021, renewable energy increased by over 8EJ. Consumption of fossil fuels was broadly unchanged. Fossil fuels accounted for 82% of primary energy use last year, down from 83% in 2019 and 85% five years ago. INTERACTIVE CHART Primary energy in 2021 grew by its largest amount in history, with emerging economies accounting for most of the increase Find out more INTERACTIVE CHART The increase in carbon emissions in 2021 was driven by the rebound in economic growth Find out more Carbon emissions Carbon dioxide emissions from energy use, industrial processes, flaring and methane (in carbon dioxide equivalent) rose 5.7% in 2021 to 39.0 GtCO 2 e, with carbon dioxide emissions from energy rising 5.9% to 33.9 GtCO 2 , close to 2019 levels. Carbon dioxide emissions from flaring and emissions from methane and industrial processes rose more modestly by 2.9% and 4.6% respectively. Oil Oil prices averaged $70.91/bbl in 2021, the second highest level since 2015 Oil consumption increased by 5.3 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2021 but remained 3.7 million b/d below 2019 levels. A majority of the consumption growth came from gasoline (1.8 million b/d) and diesel/gasoil (1.3 million b/d). Regionally, most of the growth took place in the US (1.5 million b/d), China (1.3 million b/d) and the EU (570,000 b/d). Global oil production increased by 1.4 million b/d in 2021, with OPEC+ accounting for more than three-quarters of the increase. Among all countries, Libya (840,000 b/d), Iran (540,000 b/d) and Canada (300,000 b/d) saw the largest increases. Nigeria (-200,000 b/d), the UK (-170,000 b/d) and Angola (-150,000 b/d) reported the biggest declines. Refinery capacity declined for the first time in over 30 years by almost 500,000 b/d last year, driven by a sharp reduction in the OECD (1.1 million b/d). As a result, refining capacity in the OECD in 2021 was at its lowest level since 1998. INTERACTIVE CHART Oil demand in 2021 remained below 2019 levels Find out more Trade: Russia accounted for 20-40% of the EU’s oil, gas, and coal consumption in 2021 Find out more Natural gas Natural gas prices rebounded strongly across all three major gas regions in 2021, rising fourfold to record annual levels in Europe (TTF averaging $16.02/mmBtu) and tripling in the Asian LNG spot market (JKM averaging $18.60/mmBtu). US Henry Hub prices nearly doubled to average $3.84/mmBtu in 2021 - their highest annual level since 2014. Global natural gas demand grew 5.3% in 2021, recovering above pre-pandemic 2019 levels and crossing the 4 Tcm mark for the first time. Its share in primary energy in 2021 was unchanged from the previous year at 24%. LNG supply grew 5.6% (+26 Bcm) to 516 Bcm in 2021, its slowest rate of growth since 2015 (other than in 2020). LNG supply from the US rose by 34 Bcm, accounting for most of the new incremental supplies and more than offsetting declines from mainly other Atlantic Basin exporters. China surpassed Japan as the world’s largest LNG importer and accounted for close to 60% of global LNG demand growth in 2021. Algerian pipeline exports to Europe were the largest source of pipeline supply growth to the region (+13 Bcm) last year, followed by Azerbaijan (+6 Bcm). While Russian pipeline supply to Europe overall was steady at 167 Bcm in 2021, exports to the EU decreased by 8.2% (-12 Bcm). Coal Coal prices rose dramatically in 2021, with European prices averaging $121/tonne and the Asian marker price averaging $145/t, its highest since 2008. Coal consumption grew over 6% in 2021 to 160 EJ, slightly above 2019 levels and its highest level since 2014. China and India accounted for over 70% of the growth in coal demand in 2021, increasing by 3.7 and 2.7 EJ, respectively. Global production matched consumption with an increase in supply of 440mt. China and India accounted for much of the increase in production, which was largely consumed domestically, as well as Indonesia, supporting higher exports. Notably, both Europe and North America showed an increase in coal consumption in 2021 after nearly 10 years of back-to-back declines. Electricity Electricity generation increased by 6.2% in 2021 – similar to the strong bounce back seen in 2010 in the aftermath of the financial crisis (6.4%). Wind and solar reached a 10.2% share of power generation in 2021, the first time wind and solar power have provided more than 10% of global power and surpassing the contribution of nuclear energy. Coal remained the dominant fuel for power generation in 2021, with its share increasing to 36%, up from 35.1% in 2020. Natural gas in power generation increased by 2.6% in 2021, although its share decreased from 23.7% in 2020 to 22.9% in 2021. Renewables, hydro and nuclear energy Renewable primary energy (including biofuels but excluding hydro) increased by around 5.1 EJ in 2021 – corresponding to an annual growth rate of 15%, stronger than the previous year’s 9%, and higher than that of any other fuel in 2021. Solar and wind capacity continued to grow rapidly in 2021, increasing by 226 GW, close to the record increase of 236 GW seen in 2020. China remained the main driver of solar and wind capacity growth last year, accounting for about 36% and 40% of the global capacity additions, respectively. Hydroelectricity generation decreased by around 1.4% in 2021, the first fall since 2015. In contrast, nuclear generation increased by 4.2% – the strongest increase since 2004 – led by China. INTERACTIVE CHART The share of renewables in global power generation continued to increase Find out more INTERACTIVE CHART Commodities : energy and mineral prices increased in 2021 and continued to do so in 2022 Find out more Key minerals The price of cobalt increased 63% in 2021 to average $51,000/tonne. Similarly, lithium carbonate prices rose 58% to average $11,000/tonne. So far in 2022, mineral prices have continued to surge. Lithium production rose sharply by 27%, Cobalt output was up by only 4%.

Our people have continued to work hard throughout the quarter helping to solve the energy trilemma – secure, affordable and lower carbon energy. We do this by providing the oil and gas the world needs today – while at the same time, investing to accelerate the energy transition.” Bernard Looney, chief executive officer Highlights Underlying replacement cost profit* $8.5 billion Underlying replacement cost profit was $8.5 billion, compared with $6.2 billion for the previous quarter. This was driven by strong realized refining margins, continuing exceptional oil trading performance and higher liquids realizations. This was partly offset by an average gas marketing and trading contribution, down from the exceptional result in the first quarter, including an impact from the ongoing outage at Freeport LNG. Reported profit for the quarter was $9.3 billion, compared with a loss of $20.4 billion for the first quarter 2022. The reported result for the second quarter includes a charge for adjusting items* before tax of $0.3 billion within which are adverse fair value accounting effects* of $0.8 billion. The first quarter loss included a post-tax charge of $24.4 billion relating to bp's decision to exit its 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft in Russia. Operating cash flow* $10.9 billion; net debt* reduced to $22.8 billion Operating cash flow in the quarter of $10.9 billion includes $1.2 billion of Gulf of Mexico oil spill payments within a working capital* build of $2.9 billion (after adjusting for inventory holding gains* and fair value accounting effects). During the second quarter bp executed share buybacks of $2.3 billion. The $2.5-billion programme announced with the first-quarter 2022 results was completed on 22 July. Net debt fell for the ninth successive quarter to reach $22.8 billion at the end of the second quarter. Growing distributions within an unchanged financial frame A resilient dividend is bp’s first priority within its disciplined financial frame. It is underpinned by an average 2021-5 cash balance point* of around $40 per barrel Brent, $11 per barrel RMM and $3 per mmBtu Henry Hub (all 2020 real). bp has announced a 10% increase in its quarterly dividend to 6.006 cents per ordinary share. This increase reflects the underlying performance and cash generation of the business, which has enabled strong progress in delivering share buybacks and net debt reduction. Looking ahead, on average, based on bp's current forecasts, bp continues to expect to have capacity for an annual increase in the dividend per ordinary share of around 4% through 2025 at around $60 per barrel Brent and subject to the board’s discretion each quarter. During the second quarter bp generated surplus cash flow* of $6.6 billion and intends to execute a $3.5 billion share buyback prior to announcing its third-quarter results. bp has now announced share buybacks from 2021 and first-half 2022 surplus cash flow equivalent to 60% of the cumulative surplus cash flow. For 2022 and subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, bp remains committed to using 60% of surplus cash flow for share buybacks and intends to allocate the remaining 40% to further strengthen the balance sheet. Progressing transformation to an Integrated Energy Company In resilient hydrocarbons bp has strengthened its renewal options partnering with Petrobras in a successful Drill Stem Test at the Cabo Frio discovery in the Campos Basin offshore Brazil and participating in the Timpan-1 discovery offshore Indonesia. bp continues to high-grade its portfolio, agreeing to acquire a 35% interest in the undeveloped Bay du Nord discovery offshore Canada as part of the transaction to sell its 50% interest in the Sunrise oil sands project. In convenience and mobility bp has continued to progress its EV charging strategy, recently announcing expansion plans with Iberdrola in Spain and Portugal and signing a contract to operate China's largest fast (a) EV charging hub. In low carbon energy bp has announced plans to take a 40.5% stake in the AREH project to lead and operate one of the world’s largest planned renewables and green hydrogen* energy hubs based in Western Australia; has announced its intent to partner with Iberdrola to develop large-scale integrated green hydrogen production in Spain, Portugal and the UK; and has continued to progress its renewables strategy, submitting bids for two offshore wind leases in the Netherlands. * For items marked with an asterisk throughout this document, definitions are provided in the Glossary on page 36 (a) “fast charging” includes rapid charging ≥50kW and ultra-fast charging ≥150kW Read the stock exchange announcement Dividends Results presentation bp's chief executive officer, Bernard Looney and chief financial officer, Murray Auchincloss hosted a webcast covering our results for the second quarter 2022.

But as we and the UK transition towards net zero that will change. This decade we plan to increase to 50% our capital expenditure on our transition businesses globally, and reduce oil and gas production by around 40%. The UK has a plan to boost long-term energy security and cut emissions. At bp, we’re already hard at work on the challenge. Our UK investment plans include billions for solutions like offshore wind, EV charging, hydrogen and carbon capture, as well as maintaining a secure supply of energy through North Sea oil and gas. And our plans go beyond just infrastructure - they see us supporting the economy, skills development and job opportunities in the communities where we operate.

As a national retailer of high quality coffee, we take our responsibility towards suppliers very seriously. So BP beans are all Rainforest Alliance certified and 100% sustainably sourced.

In turn, pickers and their families get support with things like education, health and housing.

From the moment we pick the coffee beans to the moment you throw away your cup, we think about reducing our impact on the planet Sustainable Sourcing We want to bring you the best tasting coffee beans. But what's also important to us is ensuring our beans are farmed in a sustainable way. With this in mind, we are proud to say that our Wild Bean coffee beans (exc decaffinated coffee) is UTZ certified. UTZ is a certification program for sustainable farming of coffee, tea, cocoa and hazelnuts. The program is part of the Rainforest Alliance, an international non-profit organization working to create a better future for people and nature. When you buy a coffee from Wild Bean Cafe, you can be sure that your coffee has arrived in your cup in a sustainable manner. That includes how it's farmed, picked, and transported to your local Wild Bean Cafe. Our UTZ certification ensures that the farming is good for nature, and the farmers have been treated fairly. To learn more about UTZ certification, please visit https://utz.org/ Re-Usable Coffee Cups At Wild Bean Cafe, we sell thousands of cups of coffee a day. But that's a lot of plastic lids, and paper cups, being disposed of each and every day. And while our cups can be recycled, we're trying to reduce our waste, but selling re-usable coffee cups. Our cups are BPA free, microwave safe, dishwasher safe, and are even 100% recyclable. Our coffee cups are available in-store for £2.00, and when you present your re-usable coffee at a Wild Bean Cafe, you'll get 30p off your hot drink. Don't have a WBC re-usable cup? Don't worry, bring any re-usable cup into your local WBC, and we'll give you the 30p discount on your drinks. Food Waste In Wild Bean Cafe, we have a waste recovery process in place whereby we reduce the price of products due to expire on a daily basis to encourage customers to purchase these lines at a discounted price and in turn massively reduces the amount of product going to waste. For any lines that aren’t sold, these are returned to our supply chain where they are recycled (there are of course some products that are excluded from this process such as dairy and raw meat). General Waste Management Like any retailer, we constantly receive deliveries into our sites. Our partner, DHL, facilitate our deliveries to over 300 Wild Bean Cafes, and DHL do an amazing job at taking away waste such as cardboard boxes, and recycling these. Did you know last year, DHL recycled over 1944 tonnes of cardboard and 71 tonnes of HDPE Bottles from bp! Thank you DHL, for helping us reduce landfill waste. As you can imagine, we are more and more conscious as a big retailer of our effect on the environment and we are constantly looking at ways to reduce waste and become a more sustainable business. Look out for more changes coming soon! Related content Our Drinks Our Food Nutritional Information BP p.l.c.
